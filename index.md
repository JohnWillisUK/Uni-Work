    <h2>DevOps Engineer</h2>
    
    <p>Welcome to my page. My name is John Willis and I am a 35 year old DevOps engineer based in Selby, England.</p>
    <p>As a DevOps Engineer at a 
        
        <a href="https://www.lloydsbank.com/insurance/home-insurance.html">large UK based bank</a>
        
        
        
        I help to transform the ways of working within General Insurance. 
    </p>
    <p>Although I now work in the <strong>DevOps</strong> space my experience is mostly based in <strong>Software Testing</strong> - an industry I worked in for a decade before setting out on my current path.</p>
    <p>Alongside my career I am also a student at Manchester Metropolitan University where I study Digital Technology Solutions on a four year apprenticeship program.</p>
    <p>I like to keep myself busy, which is no hard task with my 2 young sons, Max (5) and Leo (3). In addition to all this I love to volunteer. I manage 2 parkruns, <em>enjoy</em> a role as a volunteer for the Trans-Pennine Trail and I am currently setting up a run club in my town.</p>
